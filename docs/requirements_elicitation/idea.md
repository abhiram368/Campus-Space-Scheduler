# Steps of Requirements Elicitation

## 1. Identify Stakeholders
### Primary Stakeholders
Students and Faculty
- View available spaces (classrooms/labs/halls)
- Make booking requests
- Track booking status (approved / pending / rejected)
- View schedules
### Secondary Stakeholders
Department / Lab In-Charge
- Approve or manage bookings
- Handle conflicts
- Update room details
App Admin
- Manage users and roles
- Configure spaces (classrooms/labs/halls)
- Oversee system usage

## Hierarchy
- Category-1: Students and Faculty
